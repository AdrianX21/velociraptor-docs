This is a common TTP for achieving persistence (See Mitre Att&amp;amp;ck). Unfortunately the actual task file was later removed and event logs were cycled past the time of interest.
In that case we were able to use Velociraptor to employ some deep forensic techniques and with a bit of luck were able to recover the deleted task file.</description></item></channel></rss>
