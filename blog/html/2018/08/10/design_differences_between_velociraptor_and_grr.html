minimalist and only support a few simple primitives (such as
ListDirectory, ListProcesses etc). The intention was that most of the
processing would be executed on the server inside a "Flow". The main
motivation for this design choice was the observation that it is
difficult to upgrade the client in practice, and so with a minimal
client, it would be possible to develop more sophisticated Flows, server
side, without needing to update the clients.</p><p>After running GRR for a while we noticed that this design choice was
problematic, since it leads to many client round trips. For example the
FileFinder flow searches the client's filesystem for files by name,
date etc. GRR's original file finder uses a complex algorithm to issue
ListDirectory requests to the client, receive their responses, filter
and recurse into directories by communicating with the client again.
This leads to many round trips and has a huge performance hit on both
the server and client.</p><p>Velociraptor does away with all that by including rich client side
functionality (through VQL plugins), and implementing VQL queries to
perform the filtering. This means that in reality, Velociraptor has very
few client round trips, generally just one: The VQL query is sent to the
client, and the result is received by the server.</p><p>Some types of analysis require the results of one operation to feed into
the next operation. For example, suppose we wanted to upload all
executables that are run from a temp directory. This requires listing
all processes, then filtering the ones running from a temp directory,
and finally uploading those to the server.</p><p>GRR's model requires writing a new flow for this - the flow first
issues a ListProcesses request to the client, then receives all
processes where the filtering happens on the server. The server then
issues upload commands for each matching process. Performing this
analysis requires writing and deploying new code making it difficult to
adapt rapidly to changing threats.</p><p>With Velociraptor one simply issues the following VQL query:</p><pre><code class=language-{.sourceCode data-lang={.sourceCode>LET files = SELECT Exe, Cmdline, Username FROM pslist()
        WHERE Exe =~ '(?i)temp'
SELECT Exe, Cmdline, Username, upload(file=Exe) AS Upload
  FROM files
</code></pre><p>VQL avoids this round trip completely, since VQL queries can be nested
and chained together. Therefore one simply runs the first query (list
all processes running from temp directory), and sends the results to the
next query (download the matching files) inside the same VQL client
request. It is rare that Velociraptor flows run multiple client round
trips, resulting in lightweight and fast completing flows.</p><h1 id=worker-and-database-queues>Worker and Database queues.</h1><p>The GRR model of long running flows with multiple client/server
interactions required more complex design. Since client messages can be
delivered in multiple POST requests, and a single request can result in
multiple responses, GRR must queue responses somewhere until they are
all ready to be processed. Otherwise writing GRR flows would be
difficult because one would need to account for incomplete responses.</p><p>GRR uses a complex request/response protocol to ensure messages are
delivered in order, reminiscent of the TCP stack's packet reassembling
algorithms.</p><p>Consider the simple request "ListDirectory". The client request may
elicit thousands of responses (one for each file) and may span multiple
POST operations. The GRR frontend queues all the responses in the
database until it receives a STATUS response, and then fet once. So even
if the client sends the responses over multiple packets, the flow only
sees a single list. When a status message is seen by the frontend, it
notifies the worker via a worker queue, which collects all responses,
orders them by response ID and delivers to the flow object.</p><p>This design is necessary if flows are long lived and need to handle
thousands of responses for each request. However in practice this design
has a couple of serious problems:</p><ol><li>The frontend receives responses and just writes them into the
database in special queue rows, then the worker reads them from the
queue rows for processing (after which they must be deleted from the
database). This leads to a lot of unnecessary read/write/delete
cycles and extra load on the database.</li><li>The worker queue rows are used by all clients and all flows. This
leads to a lot of database contention on these rows. Extra care must
be taken to ensure no race conditions, through careful management of
database locks. Extra locks slow down the database and typically for
a busy system queue contention is a huge bottleneck.</li></ol><p>This is easy to observe in practice on a busy GRR system (i.e. one that
is running many flows or hunts) by simply looking at the output from
top. Typically the mysql process uses as much CPU or more than the
frontends and workers combined. This indicates a huge load on the
database and limits scalability. Increasing the number of frontends only
helps marginally because the database throughput becomes the limiting
factor. In fact, increasing the number of workers can deteriorate
performance because workers poll on their queues while holding locks
thereby increasing row lock contention even more.</p><p>Velociraptor takes a different approach. Since Velociraptor flows are
very simple and typically only consist of a few request/response cycles,
the server does not bother to reorder replies that come in different
packets. Therefore there is no need to temporarily store or queue
responses. Responses can be delivered to the flow as soon as they are
received - and flows typically just write them to the database in their
final storage location.</p><p>Therefore Velociraptor does not have a dedicated worker, nor does it
have database queues. The frontend itself runs the flows directly on the
received packets while serving the client's poll request. This
completely eliminates the need for worker queues and their associated
database contention issues. Removing the worker queues eliminates a
significant amount of very complex and delicate code. Additionally,
since the responses are not written/read to the queue, the total load on
the database is significantly reduced. (In fact because database lock
contention is so low, Velociraptor can work very well with plain files
through the FileBaseDataStore, even at large scale!)</p><p>The following illustration demonstrates how significant this is for the
simple example of a ListDirectory request of a directory with 1000 files
in it (e.g. the c:windows directory). The equivalent VQL is
select * from glob(paths='c:/windows/*') and only produces a single
response packet containing all the files in the one table, whereas
GRR's ListDirectory client action produces a single response for each
file, which is then queued and stored independently in the database.</p><p>The overall effect, in the GRR case, is that 2000 database rows are
created, of which 1000 rows are immediately deleted - a significant
database load. Compare this with the Velociraptor equivalent flow -the
VQL request is sent to the client once, then the response is returned to
the frontend in a single POST operation. Since Velociraptor does not
have a separate worker and does not need to queue messages to it, the
frontend immediately runs the flow which just writes the result into a
single DB row - total database operations: 1 row written.</p><p><img src=image1.png alt=image></p><p>Eliminating the need for a separate worker process also simplifies
deployment significantly. GRR needs to deploy separate frontends and
worker processes, and it is often difficult to know which one to scale
up. Scaling up the frontend will allow more packets to be received but
actually increases the load on the database. Not having sufficient
workers will leave many requests on the queue for a long time and will
prolong the execution of the flow since a worker must run the flow in
order to issue the next set of requests. This leads to flows which take
many hours to complete and even hung flows (if the client reboots or
disconnects before the flow finished).</p><p>Velociraptor deployment is much simpler - there is only a single binary
and it can be scaled and load balanced as needed. Since database load is
much lower, the frontend can handle a much larger load. Furthermore, the
flows typically execute in very short time (since there is only one
round trip). The overall result is that flow throughput is much
increased and resource usage is reduced.</p><footer class=footline></footer></div></div><div id=navigation></div></section><div style=left:-1000px;overflow:scroll;position:absolute;top:-1000px;border:none;box-sizing:content-box;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;width:200px><div style=border:none;box-sizing:content-box;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;width:200px></div></div><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/clipboard.min.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/perfect-scrollbar.jquery.min.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/jquery.sticky.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/featherlight.min.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/highlight.pack.js?1623396556></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()</script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/modernizr.custom-3.6.0.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/learn.js?1623396556></script><script src=/velociraptor-docs/js/hugo-learn.js?1623396556></script></body></html>
