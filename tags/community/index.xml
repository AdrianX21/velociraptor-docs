Each submission pushes the state of the art in DFIR and enhance Velociraptor&amp;rsquo;s capabilities. Without our wonderful community, an open source project, such as Velociraptor would not be nearly as capable.
We will announce the winners at the SANS Threat Hunting Summit but until then, take a look at the submissions, and decide for yourself who the winners are!</description></item></channel></rss>
