Matthew Green and Mike Cohen Velociraptor is an advanced open source endpoint visibility framework based on a flexible query language called VQL. What makes Velociraptor unique from other endpoint tools is the flexibility to develop new queries to address emerging threats.
This post walks through a common use case for Velociraptorâ€™s VQL: detecting exploitation of a new zero day (A newly announced vulnerability without a patch available).</description></item><item><title>Event Tracing for Windows</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-08-18-velociraptor-and-etw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-08-18-velociraptor-and-etw/</guid><description>Digging into Windows Internals One of the most important aspects of modern operating systems is instrumentation of the running software on the system. Instrumentation provides the visibility to understand what the system is doing at this moment. This is obviously important for system administrators and software developers, but increasing visibility into machine state is being used for security monitoring and response.
In Windows system instrumentation is provided by the Event Tracing For Windows (ETW), an instrumentation extensive framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
