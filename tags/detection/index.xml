Matthew Green and Mike Cohen Velociraptor is an advanced open source endpoint visibility framework based on a flexible query language called VQL. What makes Velociraptor unique from other endpoint tools is the flexibility to develop new queries to address emerging threats.
This post walks through a common use case for Velociraptorâ€™s VQL: detecting exploitation of a new zero day (A newly announced vulnerability without a patch available).</description></item><item><title>ETW Part 2: Process Parent Spoofing</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-09-03-process-spoofing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-09-03-process-spoofing/</guid><description>Process Parent Spoofing A lot of the current state of the art detection techniques rely on process creation logs, and their implied parent/child relationships. For example, many detection rules alert when Powershell is launched from WinWord.exe as it typically indicates a macro has started a powershell payload.
Many people are sometimes surprised to learn that on Windows parent/child process relationship is not particularly reliable. Back in 2009, Didier Stevens released a demo tool called SelectMyParent demonstrating a quirk of the Windows CreateProcess API that allows any caller to simply spoof the parent process ID.</description></item><item><title>Event Tracing for Windows Part 1</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-08-18-velociraptor-and-etw/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-08-18-velociraptor-and-etw/</guid><description>Digging into Windows Internals One of the most important aspects of modern operating systems is instrumentation of the running software on the system. Instrumentation provides the visibility to understand what the system is doing at any given moment. This is obviously important for system administrators and software developers, but visibility into machine state is increasingly being used for security monitoring and response.
In Windows, system instrumentation is provided by the Event Tracing For Windows (ETW), an extensive framework for instrumentation and visibility.</description></item></channel></rss>
