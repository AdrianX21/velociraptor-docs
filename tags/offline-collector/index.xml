While the offline collector feature is great to interactively triage a machine, the produced collection zip file is normally quite large and unwieldy to transfer.
To help with this, Velociraptor offers the option to send the file back to the cloud via a number of mechanisms, including upload to S3 buckets directly, WebDAV upload and using Secure FTP (sftp).</description></item><item><title>Triage with Velociraptor — Pt 4</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2020/2020-07-14-triage-with-velociraptor-pt-4-cf0e60810d1e/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:38:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2020/2020-07-14-triage-with-velociraptor-pt-4-cf0e60810d1e/</guid><description>&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/woman&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Woman vector created by vectorpouch &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;— &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;http://www.freepik.com&amp;#34;&amp;gt;www.freepik.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Woman vector created by vectorpouch — www.freepik.com
Velociraptor is a great tool for collecting Artifacts such as files and other state information from endpoints. Artifacts are simply VQL queries wrapped inside a YAML file providing the query with sufficient context to operate. Typically the triage phase of the DFIR process involves collecting and preserving evidence as quickly as possible, performing quick analysis in order to identify machines of interest for further analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
