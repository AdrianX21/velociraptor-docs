Users may run malicious binaries with increasingly devastating consequences, including compromise or ransomware.
To address this concern, Microsoft has introduced a standard called Authenticode, designed to sign trusted binaries, so they can be identified by the operating system. Additionally, recent versions of Windows will refuse load unsigned device drivers, therefore maintaining kernel integrity.</description></item><item><title>Parsing binary files</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-01-19-parsing-binary-files-d31114a41f14/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-01-19-parsing-binary-files-d31114a41f14/</guid><description>During the course of our DFIR work, we typically need to extract some information from endpoints from various files and registry keys on the system. Sometimes it is possible to extract the needed information using text processing tools â€” such as a regular expression applied on a configuration file.
In many cases however, the information we need is encoded inside a binary file. A large part of DFIR analysis involves parsing binary structures from files, registry keys and even event logs.</description></item></channel></rss>
