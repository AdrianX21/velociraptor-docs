My name is Carlos Canto and I have recently joined Rapid7 as the Community Engagement Manager for Velociraptor. You may be wondering what that means. In a nutshell, my job will be to increase awareness of the Velociraptor project and increase engagement among its users and contributors. Expect to hear from me a lot in the coming weeks as I begin to get my feet wet in all things DFIR.</description></item><item><title>Velociraptor 0.6.1 Release</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-09-07-release-notes-0.6.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2021/2021-09-07-release-notes-0.6.1/</guid><description>I am very excited to announce the latest Velociraptor release 0.6.1.
