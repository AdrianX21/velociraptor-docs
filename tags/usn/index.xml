One of the most important tasks in DFIR is reconstructing past filesystem activity. This is useful for example, in determining when files were introduced into the system (e.g. in a phishing campaign or drive by downloads) or when binaries were executed by way of modifications of prefetch files.
I have previously written about the Windows Update Sequence Number journal (USN). The USN journal is a file internal to the NTFS filesystem that maintains a log of interactions with the filesystem.</description></item><item><title>The Windows USN Journal</title><link>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2020/2020-11-13-the-windows-usn-journal-f0c55c9010e/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:38:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2020/2020-11-13-the-windows-usn-journal-f0c55c9010e/</guid><description>Thanks to Matt Green for discussions, ideas and codeâ€¦.
NTFS is the default filesystem on Windows systems, so it is important for DFIR tools to support extracting as much system state information as possible from it. Velociraptor already has a full featured NTFS parser, and in a recent release (0.5.2) also added a parser for the USN Journal (Update Sequence Number Journal), or Change Journal.
What is the USN Journal?</description></item></channel></rss>
