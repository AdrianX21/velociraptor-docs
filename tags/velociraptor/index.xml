In previous releases, Velociraptor was restricted to a single server performing all functions, such as serving the GUI, the gRPC API as well as connections to the clients (endpoint agents). While this architecture is regularly used to serve up to 10k-15k endpoints, at high number of endpoints, we are starting to hit limitations with the single server model.</description></item></channel></rss>
